COSC 497 - Building A Game Engine

Final Project : Cocktail Craving

When I started this project, I had trouble with implementing the bitmaps and collision. I fixed changing the bitmaps myself, but couldn't figure out the collision until that class when you helped me understand. After the collision was corrected, my game was pretty much in working condition.

I then began adding details and making sure it was bug free. I can't remember how many times I've played this game. Getting the states working was the easiest for me, as well as adding the sound. I also have the console working with the tilde key.
