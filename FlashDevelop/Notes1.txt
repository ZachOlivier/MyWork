COSC 497 Notes

Menu State aka Shell State  : Start --> Update --> End

Game State : Start --> Update --> End

Leaderboard State : Start --> Update --> End

Dont put code inside the Constructor, constructor code inside Start State

Don't put any code after changing the state in the state function

public interface iDisposable
{
	function dispose():void;
}

Keep code outside of the loop if it doesn't need to be called repeatedly "Loop Invariant"

Debug -- > Release --> Final Release

No game specific logic inside Systems, Can clear Global and start fresh if needed

"Singleton" 

System.totalMemory / 1024 = k

bitmapData.lock(); - Doesn't allow outside code to interfere
bitmapData.unlock();

deltaTime() - Holds the time in seconds
now
last
now - last / 1000; now = getTimer();

Vector3D(); for mouse position/movement

normalize(); - Makes sure the length of vector is 1
