Thanks to http://www.flashguru.co.uk/bitmapdataloadbitmap-gone-in-actionscript-3 for helping me figure out how to embed and use the bitmaps correctly. I had a lot of trouble with every part of this assigment, finally figured out some of it though.

I left most of my wrong code in there to show which directions I was attempting but failed. Let me know if you would prefer that I cleaned it up next time.
