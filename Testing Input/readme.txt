Testing Input

I was able to figure out how to implement the mouse relatively quickly. Then came the UI. After that I shift my focus to Release and Double Tap. Neither of which I ever made any progress on, at least none that I could see.

I tried so many different ways for each action. Then when we had class it made sense, and I fixed the release code pretty quickly. Thanks!
