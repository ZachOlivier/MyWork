COSC 497 - Building A Game Engine

Zombie Dispose Game

Creating the states and supporting moving between them was pretty simple. I had some delays with getting my buttons to work, I didn't realize the console was in front of everything else in the display.

I then created the 3 levels, which took a little trial and error. The most time consuming part was trying to get this console to work. I got it to output, but I kept getting an error after all of the fields filled up. Also, I couldn't get the console to work by pressing the ~.
